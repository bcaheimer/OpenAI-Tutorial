**Requirements**

The tutorial file uses the Pillow and requests libraries, which can be installed with the following commands.

`python -m pip install Pillow`

`python -m pip install requests`

**Create a Hugging Face account**

Unfortunately OpenAI has no free plans available for their API, but there are many free models available with similar capabilities. We will be using a couple of these free alternatives in this tutorial.
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/ and click sign up on the top right corner.
2. Once signed in, click your profile picture, go to settings, and select Access Tokens from the menu on the left
3. Create a new token, give it a name, and give it “read” access

**Tutorial**

The skeleton file already has a method implemented that generates an image of a given animal wearing a funny hat using the stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 model from stabilityai. Your job is to complete the implementation of the generate_caption and main functions to paste a fun fact on top of these animal pictures.

**Submission**

Email Alejandro the image and caption you get for a flamingo so he can verify you completed the tutorial.
